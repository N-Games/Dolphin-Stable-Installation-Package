# Dolphin-Stable-Installation-Package
A package that installs dolphin in Linux in a nice way. You now don't need to type all 8 commands. I wanted to make a GUI with it but it's broken lol. Just type bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N-Games/Dolphin-Stable-Installation-Package/master/fullgui.sh)" in your terminal and it you can now install Dolphin. This only works on a debian based OS
